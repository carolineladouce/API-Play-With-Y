# MapKit Yelp Fusion API 

In this app, I played with MapKit and the Yelp Fusion Api to gather and display info about nearby businesses. 

This app is built programmatically using Swift, UIKit, MapKit, Core Location, and the Yelp Fusion API. 

## How to use this app

For this demo, I selected to display places where users can find pizza or vegetables üçïü•¶

When opening the app, the app requests user permission to access their location. 
Then, users can toggle between a Map view or List view to check out nearby businesses. 
The List view cells include business name, associated emoji, price range, distance from users location.
After selecting a business, users can see more information such as walking directions, a button to call the business, or click the share button to send details to their network.
