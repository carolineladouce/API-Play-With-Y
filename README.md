# API-Play-with-Y

Hello 👋

In this app, I played with the Yelp Fusion Api to gather and display info about nearby businesses. 
This app is built using UIKit (no storyboards here!)
For this demo, I selected to display places where users can find pizza or vegetables 🍕🥦

Here are a few goals:
1. Create an app with a homescreen where users can toggle between a map view ("Map") and a UITableView ("List")
2. Upon loading the app, request user location and display the categorized businesses near the users location
3. Users can explore the Map or List to view details about the displayed businesses
4. Include business name, price range, distance from user, and associated emoji (Pizza or Vegetable) in the List cells
5. While the app is loading data, display a loading view using UIActivityIndicatorView
6. Apply custom map annotations to the home screen map. In this case, I opted for flower emojis 🌼
7. Make home screen map annotations clickable 
8. In the business details view, include: 
  a button that users can click to call the business 
  a map view with walking directions from the users location
  a share button that reveals a "share sheet" using UIActivityViewController

Here are some extra fun things that I've learned about:
1. Making a price-range display
2. How to make table view cell heights dynamic
3. UIActivityViewController, UIActivityIndicatorView, and phone call buttons

I'm still polishing the UI so stay tuned for updates 😄
